Legos were big for me. So were videogames like Roller Coaster Tycoon. They were more than just entertainment. What set them apart was how they allowed me to create and problem solve. I could take an idea for a rocket ship in my head and make it from plastic bricks, or put an idea for a waterslide I had right onto a computer screen. These were the activities that captured my attention for hours.
                                <br><br>
                                It was a similar feeling, learning to code. Taking a blank script and turning it in something useful became a new outlet to satisfy that creative part of my mind.
                                <br><br>
                                I started with HTML and CSS, and the trial-and-error of getting everything to line up and look just right didn’t bug me as much as it intrigued me. Once I added JavaScript it got really fun.
                                <br><br>
                                At the same time I started playing around with coding I was working a sales job for ReliaQuest, pitching a SaaS-based cyber security platform to enterprise-level companies. I had plenty of interactions with the software people who created our product, and started to pick their brains about what their job entails and the computer science behind what we see on the screen. 
                                <br><br>
                                Everything about the software side of the company seemed to speak to me more than the sales side.
                                <br><br>
                                So I took a risk. I left my job to dedicate myself to learning software.
                                <br><br>
                                After exploring the possibilities, I chose to do a bootcamp where I specialized in Python. I chose Python mostly because I didn’t understand the back-end side of things as well as I knew the front end.
                                <br><br>
                                They were long hours. In addition to the eight hours each day in class, I was putting in three or more outside of class. But I didn’t hate it. In fact, every day I looked forward to logging in and adding on to what I knew.
                                <br><br>
                                I graduated the Devmountain Python program after 16 weeks of study. Since then, I haven’t slowed down. I still watch videos and keep my code sharp, preparing for my professional software career."</span></h2>
